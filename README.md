# Quiz App

## About

I created this simple app for an Udacity class project. It is basically a mini quiz with four questions about superheroes.
Obs: In this project I intentionally used LinearLayout to undestand better this kind of view and related attributes, but I'm aware I could use ConstraintLayout too (for best practice).

The main objectives was to practice the following things:

- Kotlin language (if/else, when and the syntax)
- XML files creation (code-only, without visual setups)
- ViewGroups and nested ViewGroups
- View Bindind
- Explicit Intents
- Toasts
- Log and other debug utilities
 
## Built with

* Kotlin
* Android Studio
